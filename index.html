MICROSOFT, Hyderabad, India Jun. 2019 – Aug. 2021
Data and Applied Scientist II – Manufacturing, Devices Supply Chain (Global)
• Launched a cloud-based productivity platform (MTP) which helps in authoring, executing and analyzing manufacturing, test
operations and repair effectiveness.
• Collaborated with internal stakeholders (Engineers; Factory Mangers; Program Managers) in developing real-time analytics
for the Factory team to prioritize manufacturing issues and quickly identify production failures' root causes.
• Platform saves $2.5M/yr compared to prior platform; ~$1.2M in new factory setup; 180 hours/week for MTE engineering and
provides faster data availability & insights
• Led the digitization of Common Tester Platform for program managers by optimizing the utilization of testers in the factory, which
delivered cost savings of ~$2.5M by developing a proactive tool using Power BI and Power Automate, which predicts tester utilization
for upcoming 6 months.
• Collaborated with cross-functional engineering teams to digitize the manual display testing with an ML-based automated display
testing solutions, which reduced the test time by ~50% and improved the test efficiency by ~33% compared to the manual process.
Saved ~300K/yr in Opex cost.
• Defined and standardized key metrics to track the performance of the E2E manufacturing and sourcing across all T1 factories and
created unified exec scorecard, which reduced the data collation time by 5 days/month and improved data visibility
• Led Cross-functional teams to setup Microsoft Devices Sustainability initiative, involving Kelvin (Corp commitment to carbon
negative 2030) and Arthur (Zero Waste) developed analytics to understand what Microsoft's products are made of (material
composition).
HONEYWELL, Hyderabad, India & Rolle, Switzerland Feb. 2015 – Jun. 2019
Global Analytics Lead – Honeywell Building Technologies (Global)
Led, coached and collaborated with a global team of 8 supply chain analysts for Honeywell’s Building Technology ($46B in 2018)
• Delivered 35% reduction($15M) in past due by collaborating with internal stakeholders (material planners, order management;
finance etc) and identifying the inventory dense locations and moving it to the right distribution centers.
• Led cross functional weekly and monthly S&OP council meetings across 5 BUs to review supply and demand planning goals for
each region, which achieved >98% delivery rates(P98) across 100+ plants and distribution centers and improved the delivery rates
by 11% globally (On time to request)
• Led the analytics dissolution of Honeywell’s ACS (Automated Control Systems) business ($46B in 2018) into 3 BUs.
- Implemented analytics across 3 different supply chain BUs, including maintaining standard metric definitions across 400+
factories and distribution centers, while catering to analytical needs for 3000+ factory users and maintaining data accuracy
standards and metric alignment through conducting extensive training sessions.
• Led the analytics spin-off of Honeywell Building Technologies ($14B in 2019) into Resideo within 2 weeks, which involved
defining and standardizing key metrics and conducting segmentation analysis to identify slow moving items and reduced DOS by
1 day.</p>
